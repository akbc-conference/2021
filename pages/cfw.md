*Deadline: June 11, 2021*

We are soliciting proposals for half-day workshops at the third annual international conference on Automated Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC) to be held virtually in October 4-7 2021, with workshops on 7th (Thursday).

Knowledge gathering, representation, and reasoning are among the fundamental challenges of artificial intelligence. Large-scale repositories of knowledge about entities, relations, and their abstractions are known as “knowledge bases”. Most major technology companies now have substantial efforts in knowledge base construction, and related scholarly work spans many research areas, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, information integration, databases, search, data mining, knowledge representation, human computation, human-computer interfaces, and fairness. The AKBC conference serves as a research forum for all these areas, in both academia and industry.

In addition to the conference, AKBC 2021 will include workshops dedicated to vibrant sub-areas of knowledge base construction with tighter focus (e.g., scientific literature), or the intersection between knowledge base construction and other areas (e.g., trust, benchmarking, security). 

In the past, we have had workshops on topics such as multimodality, structured and unstructured KBs, scientific texts, biases in KB. Full list of workshops from previous AKBC conferences can be found here: [2020 workshops](https://www.akbc.ws/2020/workshops/), [2019 workshops](https://www.akbc.ws/2019/workshops/). Many workshops were very successful, with 100+ audiences, great line-up of invited speakers, and engaging discussions. The organizers of the accepted workshop proposals will have the freedom to organize, run, and publicize their workshop as they wish, including reviewing submissions, planning the workshop schedule, inviting speakers and planning panel discussions. 


There are also vibrant areas that involve either specialized knowledge base construction (e.g., scientific literature), or the intersection between knowledge base construction and other areas (e.g., trust, benchmarking, security).  We are soliciting proposals for half-day workshops at AKBC 2020 that connect Automated Knowledge Base Construction with these and other areas of computer science.
