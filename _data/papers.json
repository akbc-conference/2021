    "TL;DR": "We address the problem of out-of-context inference in dialogue summarization, and propose a knowledge-aware model tackling this issue.",
    "abstract": "In human dialogues, utterances do not necessarily carry all the details. As pragmatics studies suggest,  humans can infer meaning from the situational context even though the meaning is not literally expressed.  It is crucial for natural language processing models to understand such an inference process. In this paper, we address the problem of inferencing Concepts Out of the Dialogue Context (CODC) in the dialogue summarization task. We propose a novel framework comprised of a CODC inference module leveraging external knowledge from WordNet and a knowledge attention module aggregating the inferred knowledge into a neural summarization model. To evaluate the inference capability of different methods, we also propose a new evaluation metric based on CODC. Experiments suggest that current automatic evaluation metrics of natural language generation may not be enough to understand the quality of out-of-context inference in generation results, and our proposed summarization model can provide statistically significant improvements on both CODC inference and traditional automatic evaluation metrics, e.g., CIDEr. Human evaluation of the model's inference ability also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Cross-document event coreference resolution (CDCR) is the task of identifying which event mentions refer to the same event in a collection of documents. Data for this task is difficult and expensive to annotate, therefore corpora are small and lack coverage. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose to mine event coreference resolution data from hyperlinks in news articles: When referencing a significant real-world event in the body of an article, writers add a hyperlink to another article covering this event. We demonstrate that collecting hyperlinks which point to the same article(s) yields inexpensive and high-quality event coreference data. We evaluate a state-of-the-art system on three CDCR corpora and find that a model trained only on the silver-standard hyperlink data is highly competitive, performing roughly equivalent to the same model trained on gold-standard data. With our work, we free CDCR research from a dependence on costly human-annotated training data and open up possibilities for research beyond English CDCR, as our data extraction approach can be easily adapted to other languages.",

Built as an extension of Alexandria [Winn et al., 2019], the key novelty of Enterprise Alexandria is the ability in processing both the textual information and the structured metadata available in each document in an online learning fashion, making use of any manual curations that have happened in the interim. This task is performed entirely eyes-off to respect the privacy of the user and the restricted access their documents. The knowledge discovery process uses a probabilistic program defining the process of generating the data item from a set of unknown typed entities. Using probabilistic inference, Enterprise Alexandria can jointly discover a large set of entities with custom types specific to the organization. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the system outperforms alternative methods with the ability to work effectively at large scale.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs(KGs) represent factual information as graphs of entities connected by relations. Knowledge graph embeddings have emerged as a popular approach to encode this information for various downstream tasks like natural language inference, question answering and dialogue generation. As knowledge bases expand, we are presented with newer (open-world) entities, often with textual descriptions. We require techniques to embed new entities as they arrive using the textual information at hand. This task of open-world KG completion has received some attention in recent years. However, we find that existing approaches suffer from one or more of four drawbacks \u2013 1) They are not modular with respect to the choice of the KG embedding model 2) They ignore best practices for aligning two embedding spaces 3) They do not account for differences in training strategy needed when presented with datasets with different description sizes and 4) They do not produce entity embeddings for use by downstream tasks. To address these problems, we propose FOlK (Framework for Open-World KG embeddings) - a technique that jointly learns embeddings for KG entities from descriptions and KG structure for open-world knowledge graph completion. Additionally, we modify existing data sources and make available YAGO3-10- Open and WN18RR-Open two datasets that are well suited for demonstrating the efficacy of open-world KG completion approaches. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving upon state-of-the-art baselines on several tasks resulting in performance increases of up to 72% on mean reciprocal rank.\n",

This observation has given rise to recent interest in low-shot learning methods that are able to generalize from only a few examples per relation. The existing approaches, however, are tailored to static knowledge graphs and do not easily generalize to temporal settings, where data scarcity poses even bigger problems, e.g., due to occurrence of new, previously unseen relations. We address this shortcoming by proposing a one-shot learning framework for link prediction in temporal knowledge graphs. Our proposed method employs a self-attention mechanism to effectively encode temporal interactions between entities, and  a network  to compute a similarity score between a given query and a (one-shot) example. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art baselines for two well-studied benchmarks while achieving significantly better performance for sparse relations.",

This task involves the extraction of relations between entities.

Experiments with several fictional domains demonstrate the gains that KnowFi achieves over the best prior methods for neural relation extraction.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the temporal relations among events in text is a critical aspect of reading comprehension, which can be evaluated in the form of temporal question answering (TQA). When explicit timestamps are absent, TQA is a challenging task that requires models to understand the nuanced difference in textual expressions that indicate different temporal relations (e.g., \"What happened right before dawn\" indicates a small subset of \"What happened before dawn\"). In this paper, we propose to reformulate the task of TQA as open temporal relation extraction. Specifically, we decompose each question into a question event (e.g., \"dawn\") and an open temporal relation (OTR, e.g., \"happened before\") which is not pre-defined nor with timestamps, and ground the former in the context while sharing the representation of the latter across contexts. This OTR for QA formulation has two advantages: 1) it allows us to learn context-agnostic, free-text-based relation representations that generalize across different contexts and events, which leads to higher data efficiency; 2) it allows us to explicitly model the differences in temporal relations with a contrastive loss function, which helps better capture mutually exclusive relations (e.g., an event cannot simultaneously \"happen before\" and \"happen after\" another) as well as more nuanced differences (e.g., not everything that \"happened before\" an event \"happened right before\" it). Empirical evaluations on the TORQUE challenge, a recently released dataset for temporal ordering questions, show that our approach attains significant improvements correspondingly over the state of the art performance, especially gains more on EM consistency computed on the contrast question sets.

In response,  we develop RotatE-Box \u2013 a  novel combination of RotatE and Box embeddings.   It can model more relational inference patterns compared to existing embedding-based models.  Furthermore, we define baseline approaches for embedding-based KBC models to handle regex operators.  We demonstrate the performance of RotatE-Box on two new regex-query datasets introduced in this paper,  including one where the queries are harvested based on actual user query logs.

Our results show that commonsense knowledge models can rapidly adapt from limited examples, indicating that KG fine-tuning serves to learn an interface to encoded knowledge learned during pretraining. Importantly, our analysis of absolute, angular, and distributional parameter changes during few-shot fine-tuning provides novel insights into how this interface is learned.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are often used to encode knowledge graphs in order to predict new links inside the graph. The accuracy of these methods is typically evaluated by computing an averaged accuracy metric on a held-out test set. This approach, however, does not allow the identification of \\emph{where} the models might systematically fail or succeed. To address this challenge, we propose a new evaluation framework that builds on the idea of (black-box) behavioral testing, a software engineering principle that enables users to detect system failures before deployment. \nWith behavioral tests, we can specifically target and evaluate the behavior of KGE models on specific capabilities deemed important in the context of a particular use case. To this end, we leverage existing knowledge graph schemas to design behavioral tests for the link prediction task. With an extensive set of experiments, we perform and analyze these tests for several KGE models. Crucially, we for example find that a model ranked second to last on the original test set actually performs best when tested for a specific capability. Such insights allow users to better choose which KGE model might be most suitable for a particular task. The framework is extendable to additional behavioral tests and we hope to inspire fellow researchers to join us in collaboratively growing this framework. The framework will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge-intensive NLP tasks can benefit from linking natural language text with facts from a  Knowledge Graph (KG). Although facts themselves are language-agnostic, the fact labels (i.e., language-specific representation of the fact) in the KG are often present only in a few languages. This makes it challenging to link KG facts to sentences in languages other than the limited set of languages. To address this problem, we introduce the task of Multilingual Fact Linking (MFL) where the goal is to link fact expressed in a sentence to corresponding fact in the KG, even when the fact label in the KG is not available in the language of the sentence. We additionally consider cases where the sentence does not contain the complete fact but expresses it only partially. To facilitate research in this area, we present a new evaluation dataset, IndicLink. This dataset contains 11,293 linked WikiData facts and 6,429 sentences spanning English and six Indian languages. We propose a Retrieval+Generation model, ReFCoG, that can scale to millions of KG facts by combining Dual Encoder based retrieval with a Seq2Seq based generation model which is constrained to output only valid KG facts. ReFCoG outperforms standard Retrieval+Re-ranking models by 10.7 pts in Precision@1. In spite of this gain, the model achieves an overall score of 52.1, showing ample scope for improvement in the task.",

The task SHINRA2020-ML is to categorize 30-language Wikipedia pages into fine-grained named entity categories, ``Extended Named Entity (ENE)''. It's one of four tasks we have conducted on SHINRA since 2018. SHINRA is a collaborative contribution scheme utilizing Automatic Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC) systems.  The ultimate goal of the project is to create a huge and well-structured knowledge base which is essential for many NLP applications, such as QA, Dialogue systems and explainable NLP systems.\n\nIn ``Resource by Collaborative Contribution (RbCC)'' scheme, we conducted a shared task for structuring Wikipedia for the purpose of attracting participants, but at the same, submitted results are used to construct a knowledge base. One of the tricks is that the participants are not notified which is the test data, so they have to run their systems on all entities in Wikipedia, even though the evaluation results are reported only on a small portion test data among the entire data. By this methods, the organizers will receive multiple outputs of entire data from the participants. The submitted outputs are made open to the public, and will be used to build the even better structured knowledge by ensemble learning, for example. In other words, this is a project to use AKBC systems as a tool to construct a huge and well-structured Knowledge Base in collaborative manner.\n\n``SHINRA2020-ML'' task is also based on RbCC scheme. The task is to categorize 30-language Wikipedia pages into ENE. We have previously categorized entire Japanese Wikipedia entities (namely 920 thousand entities) into ENE by ML and then checked by hands. For SHINRA2020-ML task participants, We provide the training data using these categories of Japanese Wikipedia and language links from the page. For example, out of 920K Japanese Wikipedia pages, there are language links to 275K German pages. This data is used to create the training data for German and the task is to categorize the remaining 1,946K pages. We conducted a shared-task for 30 languages with largest active users, and 10 groups have participated. We will show that the results by a simple ensemble learning, i.e. majority voting, exceed the top results in 17 languages. This results proved the usefulness of ``RbCC'' scheme.\n\nWe are conducting two tasks in 2021, SHINRA2021-LinkJP and SHINRA2021-ML tasks. We will explain it in a later section of the paper.",

    "abstract": "Dense retrieval methods have shown great promise over sparse retrieval methods in a wide range of NLP problems. Among them, dense phrase retrieval\u2014the most fine-grained retrieval unit\u2014is appealing because phrases can be directly used as the output for question answering and slot filling tasks. In this work, we follow the intuition that retrieving phrases naturally entails retrieving larger text blocks and study whether phrase retrieval can serve as the basis for coarse-level retrieval including passages and documents. We first observe that a dense phrase-retrieval system, without any retraining, already achieves better passage retrieval accuracy (+3-5% in top-5 accuracy on QA tasks) compared to passage retrievers, which also helps achieve superior end-to-end QA accuracy with fewer passages.Then, we provide an interpretation for why phrase-level supervision can help learn better fine-grained entailment compared to passage-level supervision, and also show that phrase retrieval can be improved to achieve competitive performance in document-retrieval tasks for entity linking and knowledge-grounded dialogue. Finally, we demonstrate how phrase filtering and vector quantization can reduce the size of our index by 4-10x, making dense phrase retrieval a practical and versatile solution in multi-granularity retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Extracting relational knowledge from large pre-trained language models by a cloze-style sentence serving as a query has shown promising results. In particular, language models can be queried similar to knowledge graphs. The performance of the relational fact extraction task depends significantly on the query sentence, also known under the term prompt. Tuning these prompts has shown to increase the precision on standard language models by a maximum of around 12% points. However, usually large amounts of data in the form of existing knowledge graph facts and large text corpora are needed to train the required additional model.\nIn this work, we propose using a completely different approach: Instead of spending resources on training an additional model, we simply perform an adaptive fine-tuning of the pre-trained language model on the standard fill-mask task using a small training dataset of existing facts from a knowledge graph. We investigate the differences between complex prompting techniques and adaptive fine-tuning in an extensive evaluation. Remarkably, adaptive fine-tuning outperforms all baselines, even by using significantly fewer training facts. Additionally, we analyze the transfer learning capabilities of this adapted language model by training on a restricted set of relations to show that even fewer training relations are needed to achieve high knowledge extraction quality.",

We study Multilingual KGC for KGs that associate entities and relations with surface forms from different languages. In such a setting, an entity (or relation) may be mentioned as separate IDs in different KGs, necessitating entity alignment (EA) and relation alignment (RA). In addition to EA and RA being important subtasks for Multilingual KGC, we posit that high confidence fact predictions may also, in turn, add valuable information for alignment tasks, and vice versa. In response, we present the novel task of jointly training multilingual KGC, EA and RA models. Our approach, ALIGNKGC, uses mBERT-based surface form overlap for EA, and combines it with a KGC approach, extended to the multiple KG setting via a loss term that incentivizes RA. On experiments with DBPedia in five languages, we find that ALIGNKGC achieves upto 18% absolute MRR improvements in KGC compared to a strong completion model that combines all facts. It also outperforms an mBERT-only alignment baseline for EA, underscoring the value of joint training for these tasks.\n",

Unfortunately, their practical utility is diminished by their lack of interpretability. Recently, the fully interpretable, rule-based algorithm AnyBURL yielded highly competitive results on many general-purpose link prediction benchmarks. However, current approaches for aggregating predictions made by multiple rules are affected by redundancies. We improve upon AnyBURL by introducing the SAFRAN rule application framework, which uses a novel aggregation approach called Non-redundant Noisy-OR that detects and clusters redundant rules prior to aggregation. SAFRAN yields new state-of-the-art results for fully interpretable link prediction on the established general-purpose benchmarks FB15K-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10. Furthermore, it exceeds the results of multiple established embedding-based algorithms on FB15K-237 and WN18RR and narrows the gap between rule-based and embedding-based algorithms on YAGO3-10",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, entity embeddings have become ubiquitous in Artificial Intelligence. Such embeddings essentially serve as compact but semantically meaningful representations of the entities of interest. In most approaches, vectors are used for representing the entities themselves, as well as for representing their associated attributes. An important advantage of using attribute embeddings is that (some of the) semantic dependencies between the attributes can thus be captured. However, little is known about what kinds of semantic dependencies can be modelled in this way. The aim of this paper is to shed light on this question, focusing on settings where the embedding of an entity is obtained by pooling the embeddings of its known attributes. Our particular focus is on studying the theoretical limitations of different embedding strategies, rather than their ability to effectively learn attribute dependencies in practice. We first show a number of negative results, revealing that some of the most popular embedding models are not able to capture even basic Horn rules. However, we also find that some embedding strategies are capable, in principle, of modelling both monotonic and non-monotonic attribute dependencies. ",

In a thorough set of experiments, we confirm that neural link predictors trained on these augmented KGs, or in a joint Expectation-Maximization iterative scheme, can generalize better and produce more accurate predictions for infrequent relationships. For instance, our method yields relative improvements of up to 8.6% MRR on WN18RR for rare predicates, and up to 82% in small-data regimes, where the model has access to just a small subset of the training triples. Furthermore, our proposed models are able to learn meaningful concepts.",

In  recent  years, several natural language QA task have been proposed where commonsense reasoning is important. Two common approaches to this are (i) Use  of well-structured commonsense present in knowledge graphs, and (ii) Use of progressively larger transformer language models. While acquiring  and  representing  commonsense  in  a  formal representation is challenging in approach (i), approach (ii) gets more and more resource-intensive.

    "abstract": "Relation classification aims at detecting a particular relation type between two entities in text, whose methods mostly requires annotated data. Data annotation is either a manual process for supervised learning, or automated, using knowledge bases for distant learning.Unfortunately, both methodologies are costly and time-consuming since they depend on intensive human labour for annotation or for knowledge base creation. With recent evidence that language models capture some sort of relational facts as knowledge bases, one-shot relation classification using language models has been proposed via matching a given instance against examples. The only requirement is that each relation type is associated with an exemplar. However, the matching approach often yields incorrect predictions. In this work, we propose NoelA, an auto-encoder using a noisy channel, to improve the accuracy by learning from the matching predictions. NoelA outperforms BERT matching and a bootstrapping baseline on TACRED and reWiki80.",

    "abstract": "QDMR is a meaning representation for complex questions, which decomposes questions into a sequence of atomic steps, and has been recently shown to be useful for question answering. While state-of-the-art QDMR parsers use the common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approach, a QDMR structure fundamentally describes labeled relations between spans in the input question, and thus dependency-based approaches seem appropriate for this task.\nIn this work, we present a QDMR parser that is based on dependency graphs (DGs), where nodes in the graph are words and edges describe logical relations that correspond to the different computation steps. We propose (a) a non-autoregressive graph parser, where all graph edges are computed simultaneously, and (b) a seq2seq parser that uses the gold graph as auxiliary supervision.\nWe find that a graph parser leads to a moderate reduction in performance (0.47 to 0.44), but to a 16x speed-up in inference time due to its non-autoregressive nature, and to improved sample complexity compared to a seq2seq model. Second, training a seq2seq model with auxiliary DG supervision leads to better generalization on out-of-domain data and on QDMR structures with \nlong sequences of computation steps.",

    "abstract": "Relation extraction in the biomedical domain is a challenging task due to a lack of labeled data and a long-tail distribution of fact triples. Many works leverage distant supervision which automatically generates labeled data by pairing a knowledge graph with raw textual data. Distant supervision produces noisy labels and requires additional techniques, such as multi-instance learning (MIL), to denoise the training signal. However, MIL requires multiple instances of data and struggles with very long-tail datasets such as those found in the biomedical domain. In this work, we propose a novel reformulation of MIL for biomedical relation extraction that abstractifies biomedical entities into their corresponding semantic types. By grouping entities by types, we are better able to take advantage of the benefits of MIL and further denoise the training signal. We show this reformulation, which we refer to as abstractified multi-instance learning (AMIL), improves performance in biomedical relationship extraction. We also propose a novel relationship embedding architecture that further improves model performance.",

Predicting missing links in these graphs can boost many important applications, such as drug design and repurposing. Recent work has shown that general-domain language models (LMs) can serve as \"soft\" KGs, and that they can be fine-tuned for the task of KG completion. In this work, we study scientific LMs for KG completion, exploring whether we can tap into their latent knowledge to enhance biomedical link prediction. We evaluate several domain-specific LMs, fine-tuning them on datasets centered on drugs and diseases that we represent as KGs and enrich with textual entity descriptions. We integrate the LM-based models with KG embedding models, using a router method that learns to assign each input example to either type of model and provides a substantial boost in performance. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of LM models in the inductive setting with novel scientific entities.",

Previous work has focused on specific domains, mostly extracting knowledge about named entities (e.g. countries, companies, or persons) instead of general-purpose world knowledge (e.g. information about science or everyday objects). In this paper we combine the Companion Cognitive Architecture with the BERT Language Model to extract structured knowledge from text, with the goal of automatically inferring missing commonsense facts from an existing knowledge base. Using the principles of distant supervision, the system learns functions called query cases that map statements expressed in natural language into knowledge base relations. Afterwards, the system uses such query cases to extract structured knowledge using analogical reasoning. We run experiments on 2,679 Simple English Wikipedia articles, where the system is able to learn high precision facts about a variety of subjects from a few training examples, outperforming strong baselines.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge bases have multi-relations with distinctive properties. Most properties such as symmetry, inversion, and composition can be handled by the Euclidean embedding models. Nevertheless, transitivity is a special property that cannot be modeled efficiently in the Euclidean space. Instead, the hyperbolic space characterizes the transitivity naturally because of its tree-like properties. However, the hyperbolic space reveals its weakness for other relations. Therefore, building a representation learning framework for all relation properties is highly difficult. In this paper, we propose to learn the knowledge base embeddings in different geometric spaces and apply manifold alignment to align the shared entities. The aligned embeddings are evaluated on the out-of-taxonomy entity typing task, where we aim to predict the types of the entities from the knowledge graph. Experimental results on two datasets based on YAGO3 demonstrate that our approach has significantly good performances, especially in low dimensions and on small training rates.",

We present a new task of Hierarchical CDCR (H-CDCR) with the goal of jointly inferring coreference clusters and hierarchy between them. We create SciCo, an expert-annotated dataset for H-CDCR in scientific papers, 3X larger than the prominent ECB+ resource.
