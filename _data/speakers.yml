    bio: "I am Senior Director for Major Strategic AI and Data Science Initiatives USC's Information Sciences Institute (ISI). As Principal Scientist I lead the Interactive Knowledge Capture research group, which is part of AI@ISI. My research focuses on intelligent interfaces for knowledge capture, which is a central topic in our projects concerning knowledge-based planning and problem solving, information analysis and assessment of trust, semantic annotation, agent and software choreography, and community-wide development of knowledge bases. A recent focus is assisting scientists with intelligent systems that analyze data, test hypotheses, and make new discoveries. If you would like to visit us, give a talk, or join our research group, please contact me! I am also Research Professor in the Department of Computer Science and in the Spatial Sciences Institute at USC. I am Director of the Data Science Program at USC. I designed an innovative course for teaching data science to non-programmers. I am also Director of the USC Center for Knowledge-Powered Interdisciplinary Data Science (CKIDS). DataFest is a recurring, semester-long event at USC where students from different backgrounds and programs get hands-on experience in faculty-guided projects involving data science. We work with the USC GRIDS data science student organization, please contact us if you are interested in joining! Before coming to ISI in 1992, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. My thesis focused on the acquisition of planning knowledge through the formulation of deliberate experiments with the environment. I have been fascinated ever since with the challenge of enabling computers to learn new knowledge both autonomously and from being taught."

    bio: "I am an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), founding co-director of the Data System and AI Lab (DSAIL) at MIT, and co-founder of einblick analytics, inc. My group aims to dramatically increase the efficiency of data-intensive systems and democratize data science by enabling a broader range of users to unfold the potential of (their) data through the development of a new generation of algorithms and systems. This entails exploring how we can build systems to better support the recent advances in machine learning (Systems for ML) and how we can leverage machine learning to improve systems (ML for Systems). For example, with our work on SageDB we started to explore how we can enhance or even replace core systems components using machine learning models and early results suggest, that we can improve the state-of-the-art by more than an order-of-magnitude in performance. On the other hand, with Northstar we are exploring new user interfaces and infrastructure to democratize data science by enabling visual, interactive, and assisted data exploration and model building. One particular focus of this work is to help all types of users to analyse data and build models faster, but also make data exploration and model building safer by automatically preventing the user from common pitfalls."

    bio: "Monica Lam is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University since 1988. She is the faculty director of the Open Virtual Assistant Lab (OVAL). She received a B.Sc. from University of British Columbia in 1980 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1987. Monica is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering and Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Fellow. She is a co-author of the popular text Compilers, Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition), also known as the Dragon book. Professor Lam's current research is on conversational virtual assistants with an emphasis on privacy protection. Her research uses deep learning to map task-oriented natural language dialogues into formal semantics, represented by a new executable programming language called ThingTalk. Her Almond virtual assistant, trained on open knowledge graphs and IoT API standards, can be easily customized to perform new tasks. She is leading an Open Virtual Assistant Initiative to create the largest, open, crowdsourced language semantics model to promote open access in all languages. Her decentralized Almond virtual assistant that supports fine-grain sharing with privacy has received Popular Science's Best of What's New Award in Security in 2019. Prof. Lam is also an expert in compilers for high-performance machines. Her pioneering work of affine partitioning provides a unifying theory to the field of loop transformations for parallelism and locality. Her software pipelining algorithm is used in commercial systems for instruction level parallelism. Her research team created the first, widely adopted research compiler, SUIF. Her contributions in computer architecture include the CMU Warp Systolic Array and the Stanford DASH Distributed Memory Multiprocessor. She was on the founding team of Tensilica, now a part of Cadence. She received an NSF Young Investigator award in 1992, the ACM Most Influential Programming Language Design and Implementation Paper Award in 2001, an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award in 2002, and the ACM Programming Language Design and Implementation Best Paper Award in 2004. She was the author of two of the papers in \"20 Years of PLDI--a Selection (1979-1999)\", and one paper in the \"25 Years of the International Symposia on Computer Architecture\". She received the University of British Columbia Computer Science 50th Anniversary Research Award in 2018, and an ASPLOS Influential Paper Award in 2021."

    bio: "My goal is to develop trustworthy systems that can communicate effectively with people and improve over time through interaction. I broadly identify with the machine learning (ICML, NeurIPS) and natural language processing (ACL, NAACL, EMNLP) communities. Computers can do a lot, but tapping into their full power requires the rather non-trivial ability to program. I'm interested in building systems that learn to translate natural language descriptions (e.g., in English or Chinese) into programs (e.g., in Python or C++). Such systems would unlock the full power of computing to a much wider audience. A while back, I wrote a friendly introduction to natural language interfaces (XRDS magazine 2014) and a slightly more technical survey article on executable semantic parsing (CACM 2016). One idea we've explored is to \"naturalize\" a programming language gradually into a natural language (ACL 2017). One can also use natural language to describe classifiers directly rather than requiring labeled data (ACL 2018). The tension between the fuzziness of machine learning and the crispness of logic also fascinates me. On this note, we showed that neural networks can solve SAT problems with surprising accuracy despite not being told explicitly what a SAT problem is (ICLR 2019). Despite the successes of machine learning, otherwise high-performing models are still difficult to debug and fail catastrophically in the presence of changing data distributions and adversaries. For example, on the SQuAD reading comprehension dataset we created (EMNLP 2016), we showed that state-of-the-art systems, despite reaching human-level benchmark performance, are easily fooled by distracting sentences in a way that no human would be (EMNLP 2017). Given society's increasing reliance on machine learning, it is critical to build tools to make machine learning more reliable in the wild. We've worked on using influence functions to understand black-box models (ICML 2017), semidefinite programming to provide certificates a neural network is safe from a class of adversaries (NeurIPS 2018), and distributionally robust optimization to ensure the fairness of machine learning models over time (ICML 2018). Finally, I am a strong proponent of efficient and reproducible research. We have been developing CodaLab Worksheets, a platform that allows researchers to run and manage their experiments by maintaining the full provenance of an experiment from raw data to final results. Most of our recent papers have been published on CodaLab as executable papers. We are actively looking for contributors, so please contact me if you're interested!"
