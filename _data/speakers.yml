    title: "Systematic reasoning with language models"
    abstract: "While language models are rich, latent “knowledge bases”, and have remarkable question-answering capabilities, they still struggle to explain *how* their knowledge justifies those answers - and can make opaque, catastrophic mistakes. To alleviate this, I will describe new work on coercing language models to produce answers supported by a faithful chain of reasoning, describing how their knowledge justifies an answer. In the style of fast/slow thinking, conjectured answers suggest which chains of reasoning to build, and chains of reasoning suggest which answers to trust. The resulting reasoning-supported answers can then be inspected, debugged, and corrected by the user, offering new opportunities for meaningful, interactive problem-solving dialogs in future systems."

    title: "Learning symbolic rules for reasoning"
    abstract: "Symbolic reasoning, rule-based symbol manipulation, is a hallmark of human intelligence. However, rule-based systems have had limited success competing with learning-based systems outside formalized domains such as automated theorem proving. One hypothesis is that this is due to the manual construction of rules in past attempts. In this talk, I will present a method for automatic learning rules from data. This approach can express both formal logic and natural language sentences, and can induce rules from training data consisting of questions and answers, with or without intermediate reasoning steps. This approach performs well on multiple reasoning benchmarks; it learns compact models with much less data and produces not only answers but also checkable proofs."

    title: "Why natural language is the right vehicle for complex reasoning"
    abstract: "Despite their widespread success, end-to-end transformer models consistently fall short in settings involving complex reasoning. Transformers trained on question answering (QA) tasks that seemingly require multiple steps of reasoning often achieve high performance by taking \"reasoning shortcuts.\" We still do not have models that robustly combine many pieces of information in a logically consistent way. In this talk, I argue that a very attractive solution to this problem is within our grasp: doing multi-step reasoning directly in natural language. Text is flexible and expressive, capturing all of the semantics we need to represent intermediate states of a reasoning process. Working with text allows us to interface with knowledge in pre-trained models and in resources like Wikipedia. And finally, text is easily interpretable and auditable by users. I describe two pieces of work that manipulate language to do inference. First, transformation of question-answer pairs and evidence sentences allows us to seamlessly move between QA and natural language inference (NLI) settings, advancing both calibration of QA models and capabilities of NLI systems. Second, we show how synthetically-constructed data can allow us to build a deduction engine in natural language, which is a powerful building block for putting together natural language \"proofs\" of claims. I'll conclude by suggesting how these will eventually yield systems that can tackle complex, long-horizon reasoning problems."

    abstract: "Enormous amounts of ever-changing knowledge are available online in diverse textual styles and diverse formats. Recent advances in deep learning algorithms and large-scale datasets are spurring progress in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including question answering. Nevertheless, these models cannot scale up when task-annotated training data are scarce. This talk presents how to build robust models for textual comprehension and reasoning, and how to systematically evaluate them. First, I present general-purpose models for known tasks such as question answering in English and multiple languages that are robust to small domain shifts. Second, I discuss neuro-symbolic approaches that extend modern deep learning algorithms to elicit knowledge from structured data and language models to achieve strong performance in several NLP tasks. Finally, I present a benchmark to evaluate if NLP models can perform NLP tasks only by observing task definitions.  "

    title: "Citizen data scientists: how to empower your workforce to make data driven decisions"
    abstract: "Citizen data scientists (CDS) can significantly boost a firm’s business value and analytics maturity. Thus, it comes at no surprise that nowadays almost every company is looking into new tools to empower their workforce to make data-driven decisions and improve their business processes. But according to Gartner most CDS tools are focused on automated machine learning and ignore that data, people, and processes play a similar important role. Citizen data scientists need an environment that allows them to work together with SMEs and data scientists to collaboratively explore a problem across the entire model development lifecycle. Automated ML tools only impact a small portion of the development lifecycle. In this talk, I will present our findings why many current initiatives to increase the number of Citizen Data Scientist fail, explain why current tools for are still inefficient in fully supporting Citizen Data Scientists, and outline how Visual Data Computing, a technique we developed as part of the DARPA D3M program and recently commercialized by Einblick Analytics, addresses many of these challenges in a complete new way by providing the first truly collaborative analytics platform which combines aspects of a workflow engine (like Alteryx) and a visualization tool (like Tableau) with an infinite collaborative canvas (like Miro or Figma)."

    abstract: "We envision that everybody in the future can simply use their native language to retrieve information and to conduct business naturally on the web. To reach such scale, the community needs open standards to foster world wide collaboration.  We contribute to this standardization effort with an initial proposal of (1) a formal, executable representation for the meaning in dialogues, and (2) a communication protocol for inter-operating virtual assistants.  Using such a representation and leveraging pretrained language models, we can train a sample-efficient task-oriented semantic parser given the database schemas and API signatures of a domain. Making such domain-specific parsers openly available can lead to a proliferation of conversational agents in practice."

    title: "Large-Scale Deep Learning with Structure"
    abstract: "Deep learning advances have enabled us to build high-capacity intelligent systems capable of perceiving and understanding the real world from text, speech and images. Yet, building real-world, scalable intelligent systems from “scratch” remains a daunting challenge as it requires us to deal with ambiguity, data sparsity and solve complex language & visual, dialog and generation problems. In this talk, I will formalize some of these challenges involved with machine learning at scale. I will then introduce and describe our powerful neural graph learning framework, pre-cursor to widely-popular GNNs, that tackle these challenges by leveraging the power of deep learning combined with graphs which allow us to model the structure inherent in language and visual data. Our neural graph learning approach has been successfully used to power real-world applications at industry scale for response generation, image recognition and multimodal experiences. Finally, I will highlight our recent work on applying this to solve NLP tasks like Knowledge Graph reasoning and multi-document abstractive summarization."

    title: "Unlikelihood-training and back-training for robust natural language understanding"
    abstract: "Language models are known to be good at generalization and memorization. These abilities mean that a language model can be directly be used as a knowledge base, e.g., a language model could easily fill the blank in “The capital of Canada is BLANK” with Ottawa, even if the exact construction is never seen during training, a task that requires both generalization and memorization. But we also observe that complex phenomena such as negation are commonly ignored by language models, e.g., the model would still predict Ottawa as the answer to “The capital of Canada is not BLANK”. I will introduce a new training procedure and objective called “unlikelihood training with reference” in order to build language models that understand negation without explicitly training on factual knowledge. In the second part of the talk, I will show that pretrain and fine-tune paradigm breaks in the out-of-distribution setting. For example, question answering and generation models trained on Natural Questions do not generalize to other domains such as education or bio-medical. I will introduce a new technique called back-training that exploits unsupervised data in the target domains much more efficiently than self-training."
